# Forza-Telemetry-Helper

AI-assisted tuning advisor for **Forza Horizon 6**. The tool listens to the game's official
"Data Out" UDP telemetry stream, extracts performance indicators from real driving data
(tire slip, temperatures, suspension usage, RPM range, throttle/brake overlap, understeer /
oversteer balance), and turns them into **data-driven car setup suggestions** — powered by a
rules engine and an AI analysis layer.

## How it works

```
FH6 (UDP "Data Out", 324-byte packets)
        │
        ▼
  fth ingest ──► live readout (CLI)
        │
        ▼
  session metrics ──► rules engine ──► setup suggestions
        │
        ▼
  AI advisor (Ox Alpha) ──► prioritized tuning report
```

The game only **sends** telemetry (one-way UDP); it cannot receive settings back.
Suggestions are meant to be applied manually in FH6's tuning menu.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Forza Horizon 6 with telemetry enabled

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/molotovah/Forza-Telemetry-Helper.git
cd Forza-Telemetry-Helper
pip install -e .
```

## Game configuration

In FH6: **Settings > HUD and Gameplay**

| Setting             | Value                                        |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Data Out            | On                                           |
| Data Out IP Address | `127.0.0.1` (same PC) or your PC's local IP  |
| Data Out IP Port    | `20777` (avoid 5200–5300 — used by the game) |

## Usage

```sh
fth                 # live readout while driving (default port 20777)
fth --port 9999     # custom port
```

| 0     | Project scaffolding, CI                                            | ✅ done        |
| 1     | UDP ingestion + packet parser + synthetic fixtures                 | ✅ done        |
| 2     | Session recording & feature extraction (per-lap aggregates, CSV)   | 🚧 in progress |
| 3     | Rules-based tuning engine (full setup: tires, alignment, springs…) | ⏳ planned      |
| 4     | AI advisor via Ox Alpha HTTP API (offline fallback to rules)       | ⏳ planned      |
| 5     | CLI reports + community web dashboard                              | ⏳ planned      |
| 6     | Community docs, examples, contribution workflow                    | ⏳ planned      |

## Protocol notes (FH6 specifics)

- Fixed 324-byte packet format; sent at frame rate, only while driving.
- Compared with Forza Motorsport, FH6 adds `CarGroup`, `SmashableVelDiff` and
  `SmashableMass` (after `NumCylinders`) and omits `TireWear`/`TrackOrdinal`.
- Official documentation:
